# Typing Speed Test Game  

This is a simple Python-based **Typing Speed Test Game** that measures your **words per minute (WPM)** and **accuracy** based on a given prompt.  

## How It Works  
1. The program displays a sentence that the user must type.  
2. The user presses **Enter** to start the test.  
3. The timer starts when the user begins typing and stops when they finish.  
4. The program calculates:  
   - **Typing speed (WPM)**  
   - **Total time taken**  
   - **Errors made while typing**  
5. The results are displayed at the end.  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed  

## How to Run  
1. Save the script as `typingspeed.py`.  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the scriptâ€™s directory.  
3. Run the script using:  
   python typingspeed.py

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to test your typing speed!  

## Example Output  
```
Type this:- Test your typing speed with a fun Python game! Type the given sentence as fast and accurately as possible, and see your words per minute (WPM) score.  

Press Enter when you are ready to check your speed  

> User types the sentence here...

Total time elapsed: 12.45 seconds  
Your average typing speed was 36.2 words per minute (WPM)

```

## Notes  
- The program **does not handle punctuation errors**, so be mindful while typing.  
- Future improvements could include:  
  - **Dynamic difficulty levels**  
  - **Real-time error highlighting**  
  - **Leaderboard system**
